The OpenRW website is live! The new website should give new visitors some much
needed context about what the project is about and the current state of things.
We hope to publish regular-ish updates on this site to keep readers informed
about development.

In time this website should also provide links for downloading official releases
of OpenRW. However, the project is not at that stage yet. Once we have a plan
for producing releases, we'll update the site with links to them.

A big thanks to [Hugo Locurcio](https://hugo.pro/) for creating this website.

If you want the freshest development as it happens, keep your eyes on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rwengine/openrw).
